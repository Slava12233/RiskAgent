## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Database Configuration

The application uses SQLite by default, which requires no additional setup.

By default, a SQLite database file `risk_engine.db` will be created in the application directory.

#### Optional: Using PostgreSQL Instead

If you prefer to use PostgreSQL:

1. Uncomment the `psycopg2-binary` line in `requirements.txt` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
2. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# Windows
set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/risk_engine_db

# Linux/macOS
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/risk_engine_db
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
cd risk-engine
python -m app.main
```

The application will start on port 8000 and create any necessary database tables automatically.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/evaluate`: Evaluate risk for a company and get recommendations
- `GET /api/evaluations/{evaluation_id}`: Retrieve a specific risk evaluation
- `GET /api/evaluations/company/{company_name}`: Retrieve all evaluations for a company
- `GET /api/health`: Check API and database health

## Running Tests

```bash
cd risk-engine
python -m pytest -v tests/
```

The tests automatically use an in-memory SQLite database, so no additional setup is required.
